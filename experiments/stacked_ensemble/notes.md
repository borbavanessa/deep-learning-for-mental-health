## Important

To comply with the Data Usage Agreement, we removed the pre-trained models (weak classifiers and ensemble 1, 2) together with the tokenizers and embeddings from the domain. 
This is because the content of the terms can be partially retrieved through this file. Even so, we maintained the directory structure to facilitate the understanding of the code developed for the tests. For example, when training the set model, weak classifiers are loaded from the weak_classifiers folder.
